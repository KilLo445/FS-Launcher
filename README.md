# Notice  
Ghost Recon: Future Soldiers servers are currently down, Ubisoft says they are "working on it", so until they are back up, if ever, this launcher is pointless.  
  
# Future Soldier Launcher  
FS Launcher, or Future Soldier Launcher is a launcher to help get Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon: Future Soldier multiplayer working. As it can be annoying, so this program aims at helping out.  
  
Currently only Windows is suported, tested and built for Windows 10
